	\en-abstract{Since much researches have been made on the vulnerability of Deep neural networks (DNNs), we tried to generate more realistic and efficiently adversarial examples in this project.
		\\
		More precisely, we used the Adv-GAN framework to learn and approximate the distribution of original instances. Afterward, we used the generator to produce high perceptual quality adversarial examples once the Adv-GAN is trained. 
		\\
		The generator can be efficiently and independently used to generate adversarial perturbations for any given instance. Therefore, this attack can be used in both semi-white-box and black-box attacks.
		\\
		Using this method we could perform a 99.57\% attack success rate on the target model, which had a 99.3\% accuracy on MNIST dataset before the attack.
