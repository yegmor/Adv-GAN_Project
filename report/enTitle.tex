\en-abstract{Since many researches have been made on the vulnerability of 	Deep neural networks (DNNs), in this project, we tried to generate a more realistic and efficiently adversarial examples.
	 \\
	 More precisely, we used Adv-GAN framework to learn and approximate the distribution of original instances. Afterwards, once the Adv-GAN is trained, we used the generator to produce high perceptual quality adversarial examples. 
	 \\
	 The generator can be efficiently and independently, used to generate adversarial perturbations for any given instance. Therefore, this attack can be used in both semi-whitebox and black-box attacks.
	 \\
	 Using this method we could perform a 99.57\% attack success rate on the target model, which had a 99.3\% accuracy on MNIST dataset before the attack.
